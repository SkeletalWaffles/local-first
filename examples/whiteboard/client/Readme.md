# Offline . Online . Etc. story

Scenarios:
- app first-run, but no backend (either no backend chosen)
  - probably show a screen that's like "login / or continue without login / or select a different server"
  - the signup screen should do a query to the selected server to see if they require an invite code
  - indicate that you can start your own server w/ glitch
- app w/ data & login ; show indication of connectivity status
- app w/ data -- switching backend providers; need a way to connect to a backend w/o any shared history.

Should have a much better welcome screen.
