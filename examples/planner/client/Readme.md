# Todo

I really need to sort out this "cannot update something I don't have" error.
It's happening in the wild, sometimes after a long wait kind of thing.

Certainly the simplest option would be: when I encounter a syncing error like this, I request
a full dump of the data state.

And then its all good.

Yeah let's do that.

So, that doesn't fix "I made a change and forgot to send it". But we can assume that won't happen much?



Ok, so I need to write a test, right?
Do I even have tests?
